        <p><em><strong>Restauranteur | Mixologist | Blogger | Trainer | Certified Lean Six Sigma Black Belt | Wine Enthusiast | Photographer</strong></em></p>
        <p>Born in a middle-class family and firstborn of the house, I was always expected to create exemplary examples. I struggled to live up to this expectation.</p>
        <p>When I was given a chance to live away from my parents and to work, I realized my true potential. I was adaptive and quick to learn. This potential was soon realized by all my managers and colleagues alike, with whom I have worked in the past. I was determined to succeed.</p>
        <p>I moved to Australia, over there, for the first time, I discovered my passion for, both, training and mixology. I was blessed to be in a country where alcohol was not a taboo and proper education was given in order to understand it. I invested multitudes of my personal time to go through blogs, posts, training sessions, masterclasses, and seminars to get what I wanted.</p>
        <p>It was this passion of mine that took me to places and gained me a spot at one of the best casinos in Australia. It was during this time that I got one of my cocktails published in a blog run by one of the most respected figures of my industry, Gary Regan.</p>
        <p>Upon my return to India, I started out my first job with a sole focus to learn the dynamics and train and coach the staff. The efforts bore fruits when the business started to pick up. To enhance my training skills further I certified myself with Lean Six Sigma. In my new job, I invested more time in learning the tricks of the trade for Business Development and quickly built a client base for myself.</p>
        <p>My passion for mixology and wines did not die there. I completed my WSET training for level1 and am currently preparing for level 2. I tried my hand at the Court of Master Sommeliers Exam, one of the toughest exams to pass. I failed to pass the exam but gained a lot. I have recently started to put my passion into words and pictures through a blog.</p></td>
